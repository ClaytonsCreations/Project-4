## 
Utilized Machine Learning as the primary analysis to help Superstore, which is a small to mid-sized business that sells furniture, office supplies, and technology products to consumers, corporations, home offices, and small businesses. Superstore operates in the U.S. and Canada. After noticing a significant drop in sales and profits, Superstore reached out to Query Crew Inc. for assistance to:
1. Better price products to key customers in the U.S. market.
2. Revive sales and profits in the Canadian market.

## Machine Learning
